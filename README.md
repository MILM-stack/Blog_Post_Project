## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I wanted to gain better insights into the availability of accomodations in Seattle in 2016. To do so, I addressed the following questions:

1. How does the Airbnb availability look by month in 2016?
2. How does the Airbnb pricing distribution look by month in 2016? 
3. What are the top 5 neighborhoods based on availability 2016?
4. Can we predict availability for the next 12 months?

The datasets are part of Airbnb Inside, and the original source can be found [here](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/)

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook, which analyses the data in an exploratory way and gives a clear and concise answer to each of the above mentioned questions. 
Furthermore, there are markdown cells with additional information, helping the reader understand the overall process. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@maria.milman.moschenko/dont-walk-run-secure-the-best-accommodation-for-next-summer-in-seattle-0e29d1ec776d).
